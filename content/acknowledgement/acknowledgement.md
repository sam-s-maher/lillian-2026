  I would like to acknowledge the Wurundjeri (Woiworung) and Boonwurrung
  (Bunurong) people of the Kulin Nation of the land on which I write, record and
  perform. I would also like to pay my respects to all Elders past and present.
  Sovereignty was never ceded, we call for recognition and reform.
